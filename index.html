        <p> The pandemic has made New York City’s plan to expand affordable
          broadband connection in all five boroughs essential. According to data
          from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 14.7% of New York City
          households were without internet in 2019. Mayor Bill De Blasio submitted an internet
      master plan in 2019 that would commit $157 million to expand broadband
      infrastructure. </p>

      <p> However, most families who do not have internet access
        cannot afford internet.
        “This is an affordability issue at its core,” said John Paul Farmer,
        chief technology officer for the city of New York, at a virtual hearing
        hosted by the City Council to discuss the digital
        divide. “My neighbor down the block not being able to afford broadband
        becomes a public health issue,” said Farmer.</p>

      <p>According to census data from 2016, households with the lowest household
      income have the highest percentage of no internet access. As expected,
      households with the highest household income have the lowest percentage of
      no internet access. Mayor Bill de Blasio plans on working with smaller internet
      service providers in New York City to increase competition, which could
      lead to more affordable broadband internet plans. </p>
